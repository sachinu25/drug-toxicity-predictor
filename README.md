# ðŸ§ª Drug Toxicity Predictor using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

A project that predicts drug toxicity based on molecular descriptors, using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models.  
Deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app.

---

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**
Drug toxicity is a major challenge in drug discovery. This project aims to build predictive models that can estimate the potential toxicity of chemical compounds using:
- Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

The models use molecular descriptors generated from chemical structures.
